# A Weird Calculator

A very weird and unconventional calculator that works in the browser. This was a project that I learned how to build through Maximilian Schwarzmüller's [JavaScript - The Complete Guide 2020 (Beginner + Advanced)](https://www.udemy.com/course/javascript-the-complete-guide-2020-beginner-advanced/) course, with my own touch of course. I used the color palette of the iconic iPhone calculator in the design of this calculator.

Thank you for having a look at this project! 😜
